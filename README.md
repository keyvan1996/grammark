Requirements
============
To run Grammark, you need to have a browser with Javascript enabled (almost all do by default).

Build Architecture
============
- [AngularJS version 1.x](https://angularjs.org/)
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) CSS/JS library
- [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)

Out-of-Box Installation
=======================
If you just want your own version of Grammark on your server, head on over to https://github.com/markfullmer/grammark/tree/angular-distribution.
Clone the files, or download the zip into a directory on your server.

You should now have a fully-functional grammar checker!

Developer Installation
======================
1. Clone the master branch of this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:markfullmer/grammark.git .
```
2. Grammark is built on the [yeoman angular scaffolding](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
To facilitate easy development, install `yo`, `grunt-cli`, `bower`, `generator-angular` and `generator-karma`:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo generator-karma generator-angular
```
You can then use the following for local development:

```

```
